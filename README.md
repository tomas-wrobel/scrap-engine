# Scrap Engine
Scrap Engine is a modified version of blockLike.js. The main difference is an absence of rewriter. While BlockLike.js rewrites functions, Scrap does not. Scrap Engine is not intended to be used outside of an output of [Scrap](https://github.com/tomas-wrobel/scrap).

# BlockLike.js

BlockLike.js is an educational JavaScript library. It bridges the gap between block-based and text-based programming.

BlockLike.js is designed following [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) concepts, methods and patterns. The screen is a centered stage. Interaction is with Sprites. Code is executed in a "paced" manner. Scratch block code and BlockLike.js text code are meant to be as literally similar as possible.

BlockLike.js is written in ES6/ES7 flavored JavaScript. It is environment independent. It can be used anywhere modern JavaScript runs.

See [BlockLike.org](https://www.blocklike.org) for details, [docs](https://www.blocklike.org/docs), [examples](https://www.blocklike.org/example) and [FAQ](https://www.blocklike.org/faq.html).
