/**
* BlockLike.js
*
* BlockLike.js is an educational JavaScript library.
* It bridges the gap between block-based and text-based programming.
*
* BlockLike.js is designed following Scratch concepts, methods and patterns.
* The screen is a centered stage. Interaction is with Sprites.
* Code is executed in a "paced" manner.
* Scratch block code and BlockLike.js text code are meant to be
* as literally similar as possible.
*
* BlockLike.js is written in ES6/ES7 flavored JavaScript.
* It is environment independent.
* It can be used anywhere modern JavaScript runs.
